# SuperMarket-Sim-MC-Simulation

In this project,I write a program that simulates customer behaviour in a supermarket.
The project involves the following tasks:
explore the data (includes pandas wrangling)
calculate transition probabilities (a 5x5 matrix)
implement a customer class
run a MCMC simulation for a single customer
extend the simulation to multiple customers
